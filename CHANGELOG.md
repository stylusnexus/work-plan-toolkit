## 2026.06.13+bb0dbea — 2026-06-13 (#314)

feat: Plans-view plan-writes, GitHub issue-close + auth fast-fail, track↔plan link & push-track

A large feature batch (9 PRs) making the VS Code Plans view *act* instead of only report, plus GitHub-path hardening and track-sharing.

## Plan frontmatter writes (#286 — all confirm-gated, frontmatter-only)
- **Confirm Verdict** (`plan-confirm`) — pin a human `verdict_override` to silence a false "shipped but boxes unchecked" lie-gap.
- **Acknowledge & Save to Doc** (`plan-ack`) — a durable, shared `acknowledged` ack (vs the per-machine default).
- **Stamp Baseline — Watch for Drift** (`plan-baseline`) — records the verdict; `plan-status` then flags **drift** when a once-shipped plan silently regresses (declared files deleted/moved).
- Read-only **off-tree manifest** flag — surfaces declared paths that resolve outside the repo.
- Shared, escape-guarded + public-repo-gated frontmatter writer (`lib/plan_fm`).

## Track ↔ plan link (#285)
- A track declares its plan via `plan:` frontmatter; `export` resolves an execution badge; the detail panel offers one-click **Plan** navigation. No fuzzy matching.

## GitHub path
- **Close Issue on GitHub** (`close-issue`, #305) — close an issue (optional comment) from the untracked-issue right-click or a detail-panel row, gated by a mandatory "cannot be undone" modal. Joins `plan-status --issues` (create) as the toolkit's second opt-in, gated GitHub write.
- **Fast-fail auth** (`auth-status`, #307) — a "Not signed in to GitHub" / "GitHub CLI not found" banner + Sign-in path replaces the silently-empty tree.
- **Fetch Open Issues** (#303) — pull a trackless registered repo's open issues on demand into its Untracked bucket.

## Track sharing (#306)
- **Push to Shared Tier** (`push-track`) — promote a private track into the repo's shared `.work-plan/` plan branch and push (public-repo exposure gated).

## Docs/security
- READMEs reframe the GitHub-write posture (two opt-in gated writes: create + close) and SECURITY.md documents the new write surfaces (frontmatter writers, close-issue, push-track).

CI green across the 3.9–3.12 × {ubuntu,macos,windows} matrix + lint + vscode build on every PR; the full dev→main diff was code-reviewed clean (no blockers/highs). CLI 959 tests, viewer 516.

VS Code extension bumped 0.6.3 → **0.7.0**.

feat(vscode): track-only repos show as a greyed "not registered" row in Plans (ext 0.6.3)

## Summary

Closes the other half of the Tracks/Plans asymmetry (companion to 0.6.2). A repo with **tracks but no `repos:` config entry** can't be scanned by the Plans view — it resolves a local clone by config *folder key*, which a track-only repo lacks — so it was silently absent from Plans while appearing in Tracks.

Plans now lists such repos as a **greyed, non-expandable "not registered" leaf** after the real repo nodes: `circle-slash` icon, "not registered" description, a tooltip explaining why, and a click that launches **Add Repo** prefilled with the slug (and a key derived from it).

## How

- `unregisteredTrackRepos(export)` — a pure, vscode-free helper: distinct, sorted GitHub slugs that tracks reference but `exp.repos` doesn't contain (null/empty excluded).
- New `PlanNode` variant `{ kind: "unregistered"; slug }`; roots render registered repos first, then unregistered leaves.
- Sourced from the **raw** export and kept **separate from the scan list**, so Scan All / the stalled roll-up never try to scan a repo with no registered clone.
- `workPlan.addRepo` gains an optional `{ github, key }` seed, guarded with `typeof seed?.github === "string"` so a menu/palette context can't masquerade as a prefill.

## Tests (plain English)

New `unregisteredTrackRepos` suite: slug absent from repos → returned; slug present → excluded; duplicate track slugs → once; null/empty repo → excluded; missing `repos` field → all returned; all-registered → empty; result sorted.

## Verification

- `npm test` → 477 pass (+7 new)
- `npm run typecheck` → clean
- `vsce package` → clean (1.26 MB)
- code-reviewer pass (scan-path isolation + seed guard confirmed; a README changelog dup it flagged is fixed)

## Scope

VS Code-only — Python CLI unchanged, so **npm publish is skipped**. Bumps extension to **0.6.3**; Marketplace + Open VSX publish via the GitHub Release after merge.

## 2026.06.13+571c7a6 — 2026-06-13 (#298)

fix(vscode): zero-track registered repos now show in the Tracks view (ext 0.6.2)

## Summary

A registered repo with **no tracks yet** (e.g. a just-added `agent-armor`) appeared in the **Plans** view but was missing from **Tracks**. Root cause: the Tracks view renders from the lens-filtered export, and `applyLens` rebuilt the `Export` forwarding only `tracks`/`untracked` — silently dropping the configured `repos` list (#288). So `buildTree`'s empty-repo seeding loop iterated `[]` and zero-track repos vanished under every lens, including "All". The Plans view reads the raw export, so it kept showing them. Same class of bug as the `#99` untracked-forwarding fix, one field over.

## Changes

- `applyLens` now forwards `repos` unchanged (alongside `untracked`).
- Regression test block in `lenses.test.ts` (`#288`): forwards under `all`, forwards under a `repo` lens, undefined when absent.
- VS Code extension bumped **0.6.1 → 0.6.2**; README `## Status` line updated.

## Scope

VS Code-only — the Python CLI is unchanged, so **npm publish is skipped** (same as the 0.5.1 precedent). Marketplace + Open VSX publish via the GitHub Release after merge.

## Verification

- `npm test` → 470 pass (incl. 3 new)
- `npm run typecheck` → clean
- `vsce package` → packages cleanly (1.26 MB)

fix(vscode): Plans view papercuts (ext 0.6.1)

Extension-only patch (no CLI change; `MIN_CLI_VERSION` unchanged). VS Code extension **0.6.1**.

Post-0.6.0 UX fixes to the new Plans view, from live use:
- **Plans section collapsed by default** so Tracks stays the hot path.
- The **"Scan all repos for stalled plans…" empty-state is clickable** — runs the scan directly (the title-bar icon alone was undiscoverable).
- **Scan All uses a `$(telescope)` icon** instead of `$(search)` (the magnifying glass read as the Tracks Search and was ambiguous).
- **Trimmed the Plans title bar** — Toggle Show Acknowledged moved to the `…` overflow, leaving Scan All + Refresh.

npm publish skipped (CLI unchanged); VS Code Marketplace + Open VSX publish via the release.

## 2026.06.13+627d944 — 2026-06-13 (#293)

feat: Plans view, registered-repo management, list-pickers, Open Track File

Deploy of the 2026.06.13 release. Extension **0.6.0**; CLI floor **2026.06.13**.

## Highlights

### Plans view (#164)
A new read-only **"Plans"** tree in the VS Code extension surfacing plan/spec docs and their `plan-status` health, loud on the two states that matter to spec-driven work:
- **stalled** — a `partial` plan whose *declared manifest files* have gone cold (no commit within the threshold) = "started executing, drifted off". Keyed off manifest-file git activity, not the (gitignored) plan doc's own date.
- **lie-gap** — scored shipped but its own phase checkboxes aren't ticked.
Lazy per-repo scanning, a cross-repo **"Scan All"** stalled roll-up (bounded-concurrent + streaming), click-to-open, **acknowledge/dismiss** (local, demote-not-hide), and a `workPlan.stallDays` threshold ("Match CLI" / 14/30/45/60/90). CLI side: `plan-status --json` gains `manifest_last_touched`/`stalled`/`lie_gap`/`unchecked_items`/`stall_days` + `--stall-days` flag and config.

### Registered repos are first-class (#288, #290)
`export --json` emits a top-level `repos[]` of every configured repo. A registered repo now appears in the sidebar **even with no tracks** (right-click → **New Track** to start) and in the Plans view if it has a local clone. Full repo management: **Add Repo** (honest feedback, re-add to set local), **Remove Repo**, **Clear Local Path** — destructive actions behind clear blocking modals that itemize what is/isn't deleted.

### Quality-of-life
- **Open Track File** (#211) — open a track's underlying `.md` from the tree or detail panel.
- **List-pickers** (#212, #282) — Move, Set Next-Up, and Add Issue to Track now pick from the known issue list (filterable) instead of retyping numbers.

### CLI data-integrity fixes (#255, #256)
- `reconcile --all` now keys state by `(repo, path)` — no more cross-repo membership bleed on duplicate slugs.
- `refresh-md` skips a track on an incomplete GitHub fetch instead of overwriting valid rows with `(not fetched)`.

## Notes
- `MIN_CLI_VERSION` → 2026.06.13 (the Plans view + repos[] listing need the new export/plan-status fields; older CLI shows a compat warning).
- Deferred follow-ups: #285 (track↔plan nav), #286 (V2 plan writes), #287 (reactive staleness).

fix(vscode): Daily Brief icon + re-entrancy guard (0.5.1)

Small VS Code extension fix — **0.5.1**.

- **fix(vscode): clearer Daily Brief icon + re-entrancy guard** — swap the Daily Brief title-bar `$(list-unordered)` (VS Code's hamburger/list glyph) for `$(checklist)`, and guard re-entrancy so repeat-clicks no longer spawn concurrent `brief` runs + stacked progress toasts.

## Versions
- VS Code extension hand-bumped **0.5.0 → 0.5.1** (`vscode/package.json` + `## Status`).
- **CLI/npm is unchanged** (Python skill untouched) — no npm republish this deploy; only the VS Code extension publishes.

## 2026.06.11+60c2651 — 2026-06-11 (#276)

feat: VS Code extension 0.5.0 — issue search, daily-driver commands, lens/sort indicator

VS Code extension **0.5.0** — a daily-driver + discoverability release. Bundles four feature PRs plus a screenshot refresh.

## Highlights

- **feat(vscode): keyword issue search (#272)** — new **Search Issues…** command (title-bar `$(search)` + palette) matches issue titles across every track and the Untracked bucket with a `%wildcard%` grammar: `%depends%` (contains), `fix%` (starts-with), `%audit` (ends-with), bare word = contains; case-insensitive. Matching is client-side. Results open in a dedicated, reusable **Issue Search** tab (grouped by repo, open issues first) — click a row to open on GitHub, or use the per-row reveal button to jump to the owning track in the tree. Strict-CSP, accessible, theme-adaptive; an "as of `<generated_at>`" line + Refresh & re-run.

- **feat(vscode): daily-driver relay commands (#210)** — **Daily Brief**, **Re-orient (Where was I)**, and **Wrap Up Session (Handoff)** are now runnable from the title bar / track right-click menu / palette, relaying the CLI's verbatim output to the Work Plan output channel. Handoff routes through the public-write confirm flow.

- **feat(vscode): active lens + sort indicator (#209)** — the active filter/sort is surfaced inline under the Tracks view title (e.g. `milestone: v2.0.0 · blocked-first`), clearing when you return to All tracks + default sort.

- **fix(vscode): numeric-aware milestone sort (#268)** — milestone entries in the Select View filter now sort numerically (`v0.5.0` before `v0.10.0`) instead of issue-iteration order.

- **docs(vscode): refresh dependency-graph screenshot (#223)** — community contribution (@Hritik-Kumar-dev): neutral demo-data screenshot showing current 0.4.x/0.5.0 features.

## Versions
- VS Code extension hand-bumped **0.4.2 → 0.5.0** (`vscode/package.json`); `## Status` line + root README updated.
- CLI VERSION (CalVer) + npm version are stamped automatically on this merge.

## Verification
- vscode: typecheck clean, **416** tests pass, production build OK.
- Full Python + vscode CI matrix green on dev.

## 2026.06.11+51bbb9a — 2026-06-11 (#267)

fix(vscode): render visibility×tier badge as Unicode glyphs in the tree

Ships the VS Code extension **v0.4.2**.

### Fixed
- **Visibility × tier badge rendered raw codicon tokens.** The per-track badge emitted `$(globe)` / `$(lock)` / `$(cloud)` / `$(warning)` as literal text in the tree, because `TreeItem.description` is plain text and never resolves `$(icon)` syntax. The badge now uses Unicode glyphs (🌐 / 🔒 / ☁️, ⚠️ for the exposed state) so it renders as intended. The hover tooltip was already correct (themed `MarkdownString`) and is unchanged.

No CLI changes this deploy — viewer-only fix. Extension bumped 0.4.1 → 0.4.2; `vscode/README.md` Status line updated.

## 2026.06.11+b34452d — 2026-06-11 (#265)

feat: canonical plan branch for the shared tier + visibility×tier badge (extension 0.4.1)

Production deploy. Extension bumped to **0.4.1**. Ships the #260 canonical-plan-branch feature (CLI) and the #259 visibility × tier badge (VS Code viewer).

## CLI — shared-tier planning on one canonical branch (#260)

The shared (`.work-plan/`) tier can now be pinned to **one canonical `plan_branch`** per repo, read and written through a dedicated git worktree — so planning lives off your code branches and never pollutes feature PRs or the `dev → main` deploy diff, yet the CLI and viewer always show the canonical plan from any checkout.

- **`plan-branch <init|status|push> <repo>`** — the bootstrap + share command. `init` creates an **orphan** branch (default `work-plan/plan`, like `gh-pages`; `--branch` overrides) with a `.work-plan/` skeleton, or **connects** to a teammate's already-published branch — **local only**. `status` reports exists / published / unpushed. `push` shares it, gated by a confirm token on **public** repos (with `--dry-run` to preview the exposure first).
- Discovery, shared-track creation (`group`/`new-track`), and the dispatcher's auto-commit all route through the plan-branch worktree when one is configured; repos without a `plan_branch` keep the legacy working-tree `.work-plan/` behaviour unchanged.
- Hardened to the notes-vcs data-safety bar across multiple adversarial review rounds: scoped commits (only the paths a command changed, NUL-delimited porcelain so spaced/non-ASCII filenames are safe), branch-verified worktree reuse, the public-repo exposure gate fails closed, and the whole path honours the never-raise contract.

## VS Code viewer — visibility × tier badge (#259), extension 0.4.1

Every tree item now carries a **visibility × tier badge** (🔒 private / 🌐 public repo, ☁ shared tier) that flags the one **exposed** state — a plan committed to a *public* repo's shared tier is world-visible. Theme-adaptive, with a MarkdownString tooltip explaining the state.

## Docs
README gains a "Canonical plan branch" section (with the CI-exclude tip) and a `plan-branch` command-table row; the extension README documents the badge and the 0.4.1 status.

Closes #259, #260.

## 2026.06.11+8c21445 — 2026-06-11 (#258)

feat: viewer UX + accessibility overhaul, notes-vcs safety, CLI clarity (extension 0.4.0)

Production deploy. Extension bumped to **0.4.0** (feature-heavy, non-breaking).

### VS Code viewer — UX
- **De-noised command palette**: commands moved the `Work Plan:` prefix into the `category` field, so titles are clean, searchable verbs; argument-only commands gated out of the palette.
- **Clearer command names**: *Refresh Track Body → Sync Issue States from GitHub*, *Reconcile (preview) → Check Label Drift (preview)*, *Slot Issue into Track → Add Issue to Track*, *Set Next-Up → Set Next-Up & Log Session* (it runs `handoff --set-next`, which also logs a session). CLI `--help` aligned.
- **Frequency-grouped track context menu** with separators fencing the destructive actions, plus **confirmation modals** before *abandon* (Close) and *Rename*.
- **Per-milestone filter**: an explicit *filter* control on each milestone band re-scopes the whole view; the result is clearable straight from its toast.
- **Progress feedback** on every write command.

### VS Code viewer — theming & accessibility
- **Editor-theme-adaptive** webview: Mermaid graph + detail-card colours follow light / dark / high-contrast (via `--vscode-charts-*` tokens + a forced-colors fallback), re-rendering on theme change.
- **Accessibility sweep**: distinct *shapes* for track status (not colour alone), keyboard-operable disclosures and depends-on chips with `aria-expanded`/labels, focus-visible move button, table `scope`/caption semantics, a graph text alternative, and a non-colour `⛔` marker on blocked graph nodes.

### Local history (notes-vcs) — opt-in, hardened
- Opt-in personal version control for the private `notes_root` tier with one-click Undo in the viewer, now with **safety boundaries**: refuses a `notes_root` that has a git remote or is a repo work-plan didn't create; commits **only the files a command changed** (pre-existing edits preserved); Undo/revert is gated on repo ownership + no-remote and on the new commit sitting directly on the previously-seen HEAD.

### CLI & housekeeping
- Clarified `refresh-md` / `reconcile` / `set` vs `handoff --set-next` help text.
- Stopped tracking agent scratch state (`.claude/agent-memory`, worktrees) in this public repo.

Closes #103, #207, #208, #214, #217, #218, #219, #224, #227, #228, #229, #230, #231, #232, #233, #238, #244, #248, #249, #250.

## 2026.06.10+a3d10bf — 2026-06-10 (#222)

feat: rename-track + milestone-ordered tracks (CLI & viewer)

Production deploy. Highlights since the last release:

### `rename-track` (#174)
New `rename-track <old-slug | old@repo> <new-slug>` CLI verb — renames a track's slug: moves the `.md` file (write-new-then-unlink-old, so a failed write leaves the original intact), updates the frontmatter `track` field + `last_touched`, and reuses the public-repo confirm-token gate. Shared tracks get an opt-in `--commit`; `--fix-refs` rewrites sibling tracks' `depends_on`. Surfaced in the VS Code viewer as a **Rename Track** right-click action.

### Milestone ordering within tracks (#101)
A track that mixes near-term and far-future issues now keeps "what's next" above "someday", everywhere it renders:
- **Viewer:** per-track milestone bands are ordered active-milestone-first (the track's `milestone_alignment` band first), not alphabetically.
- **CLI:** the canonical issue table is a single milestone-ordered table with a `Milestone` column (active milestone first, groups divided by a blank row). `refresh-md` re-derives it each run, so it self-heals instead of decaying. Replaces the old multi-section rendering that didn't round-trip.
- No-drift by construction: the markdown table and the viewer both derive order from the one `milestone_sort_key`; the canonicalize → refresh-md round-trip is byte-identical.

### VS Code extension → v0.3.6
Adds the Rename Track action and active-milestone-first band ordering. Marketplace + Open VSX.

### Docs
- CLAUDE.md: cross-project **model-routing** guidance; a deploy note to keep the `vscode/README.md` Status line in lockstep with the extension version.

fix(security): CLI + VS Code extension hardening (injection fixes, extension RCE)

Security release from a full review of the CLI and the VS Code extension, plus CI and public-repo hygiene. VS Code extension → 0.3.5; npm CLI republished.

### Security fixes
- **yq expression injection** in `set-notes-root` — a path containing `"` could rewrite arbitrary `config.yml` keys. Values now pass to `yq` via `strenv()`/`env()` (#191).
- **git option injection** via dash-led `github.branches` frontmatter → arbitrary file overwrite (`git log --output=`). Dash-led revs are now rejected (#192).
- **VS Code extension RCE** — `workPlan.cliPath` was workspace-overridable and spawned on activation. Now machine-scoped + `untrustedWorkspaces: { supported: false }` (#193).
- **Argument injection** via `--`-prefixed track names — CLI now honours a `--` end-of-options separator and rejects dash-led track filenames; the extension passes positionals after `--` (#194).
- **Hardening**: path-write containment + symlink-write guard (#195); `gh`/`git` subprocess timeouts, repo-slug validation, answers int-coercion (#196); webview confirm-modal consistency, Mermaid label newline handling, CSP/escaper nits (#197).

### Also in this release
- **CI**: GitHub Actions bumped to Node-24 majors (checkout v6, setup-node v6, upload-artifact v7, download-artifact v8) (#190).
- **Public-repo readiness**: CLAUDE.md now tracked for contributors; internal project references + a leaked maintainer path scrubbed repo-wide; SECURITY.md advisory history updated; issue templates + agent-doc cross-links added (#200, #201).

### Versions
- VS Code extension → **0.3.5**
- npm CLI republished (same-day CalVer, `-1` suffix)

Full suite green (Python 657 + lint matrix; vscode typecheck + 335 tests).

## 2026.06.10+a6052bf — 2026-06-10 (#189)

feat: reconcile auto-move + non-TTY hang fix, list --sort, viewer status lens

Production deploy. Ships four issues plus docs and the VS Code extension bump to 0.3.4.

### Fixes
- **#183 — `fix(prompts)`: non-TTY prompt hang.** `hygiene`/`reconcile` launched from the VS Code extension could block forever on a prompt (stdin is an open pipe that never delivers a line and never EOFs). All prompt helpers now fall back to their default when stdin is not a TTY. Adds `reconcile --yes` (auto-apply, local-write only) and `hygiene` forwards it.

### Features
- **#163 — `feat(reconcile)`: label-driven auto-move.** In an `--all`/`--repo` sweep, an issue relabeled from one track to another in the same repo is moved (removed from the old, added to the new) instead of dangling as a FLAG + duplicate ADD. Ambiguous targets stay FLAGs. PUBLIC-repo destinations are skipped under `--yes`.
- **#181 — `feat(list)`: `--sort`.** `list --sort=recent` (by `last_touched`) and `--sort=priority` (P0→P3, recency tiebreak); default keeps discovery order.
- **#180 — `feat(viewer)`: status filter lens.** New Active / Shipped / Parked lens in the VS Code viewer's Select View.

### Chore / docs
- VS Code extension bumped `0.3.3 → 0.3.4` for the status-lens Marketplace + Open VSX release.
- README + vscode/README updated for the new flags and lens.

Full suite green (644 tests).

Deploy: repo-scoped full map (v0.3.2)

## Change
The 'Show full map' graph now only shows tracks in the **same repo** as the selected track. Cross-repo tracks share no edges, so showing them together produced noise without value.

## Changes in this deploy

### #172 — Mermaid label escaping fix
- Replaced HTML entities with safe literal characters in `mermaidLabel`
- Mermaid 11.x's `entityDecode` was silently undoing all entity escaping, allowing `"]` sequences to break the parser
- Fix: `"` → `'`, `[{` → `(`, `]}` → `)`, backtick → `'`

- VSCode context menu "Move Issue from Track" with QuickPick destination
- Added to `WriteAction` type with full public-repo confirm gate
- 13 CLI tests + 1 VSCode test

### #175 — Surface `depends_on` in detail panel + README

- Adds optional `version_suffix` input to `npm-publish.yml` (e.g. `"-1"` → publishes `2026.6.9-1`)
- Allows same-day npm republish when the CalVer semver is already taken, without changing the VERSION file
- Used immediately after creation to publish `@stylusnexus/work-plan@2026.6.9-1` (CLI improvements from #151/#152 that landed after today's first npm publish)

feat(reconcile,hygiene): parallel gh fetches, per-call timeouts, progress indicators

## Summary

- **#151** `perf(reconcile,hygiene)`: parallel `gh` fetches in `reconcile --all` via `ThreadPoolExecutor` (4 workers); per-call 15s timeout per track; `--timeout=N` flag forwarded to `duplicates`; per-step timing in `hygiene`
- **#152** `feat(hygiene,reconcile,refresh-md)`: `[N/total]` progress indicator during `--all` sweeps in all three subcommands; also fixes latent `NameError` in `hygiene.py` step-2 timing (referenced `t2` before assignment)
- New test module: `test_reconcile_readonly.py` — timeout/skip behaviour for single-track and multi-track parallel paths

docs(readme,skill): clarify refresh-md and hygiene, add read-only callout, vscode README v0.2.0

## Summary

- **SKILL.md + README.md**: rewrote `refresh-md` guidance — removed "you usually don't need this" framing; it's the right tool to run after closing issues. Expanded `hygiene` description to enumerate all three steps (refresh-md + reconcile + duplicates).
- **README.md + vscode/README.md**: added explicit GitHub read-only callout — the toolkit never writes to GitHub; all writes are local markdown files only.
- **vscode/README.md**: added `workPlan.autoRefreshInterval` to the configuration table; bumped Status line from v0.1.0 → v0.2.0 with feature summary.

## Commits

feat(shared-notes,coverage,auto-triage): two-tier tracks, coverage report, AI triage, next_up fix

## What's shipping

### Major: shared-notes (two-tier track storage)
Track files can now live inside a repo clone (`.work-plan/<slug>.md`, git-synced) alongside the existing private `notes_root` tier. Register a local clone with `init-repo --local=<path>`; tracks route there automatically. Teammates share planning state via `git pull`/`git push`. `--private` opts out per-command.

Phases A–D:
- Phase A: `discover_tracks` unions shared + private; `AmbiguousTrackError` for same-slug-different-repo
- Phase B: `--repo=<key>` / `<track>@<repo>` disambiguation on all write verbs
- Phase C: write-surface routing (`group`, `new-track`, `close`, `init`)
- Phase D: `init-repo` detects existing `.work-plan/` tracks; `new-track --commit`; `export` tier field

### New: `coverage` command
`/work-plan coverage [--repo=<key>] [--list]` — reports how many open issues are outside the track model. 42% orphan rate measured on a real production repo.

### New: `auto-triage` command
`/work-plan auto-triage [--repo=<key>] [--apply]` — two-step AI assignment of untracked issues to existing tracks. Complements `group` (which creates new tracks).

### Fix: closed issues filtered from `next_up` in export
The VS Code viewer was showing closed issues as actionable next-up nodes. Export now cross-references `next_up` against the fetched issue states and removes confirmed-closed entries.

### Docs
README, SKILL.md, npm description, and VS Code extension description updated with shared-notes setup, group/auto-triage callouts, and `@repo` disambiguation syntax.

feat: npm CLI distribution + launcher PATH fix + extension v0.1.1 (screenshots, docs)

Production deploy bundling the post-launch polish: npm distribution for the CLI, the GUI-PATH launcher fix, expanded docs, and the assets/version bump for the extension's `0.1.1` listing refresh.

## CLI — npm distribution
- **`@stylusnexus/work-plan` npm package** (root `package.json` + `scripts/npm-check-deps.js`): ships the Python CLI + launcher so `npm install -g @stylusnexus/work-plan` works (no repo clone). `files`-whitelisted (488 kB, no leaks); pure Python still, no build step. Plus `.github/workflows/npm-publish.yml` (CalVer→semver, `--access public`, `NPM_TOKEN`).
- **Launcher GUI-PATH fix** (`bin/work-plan`): GUI editors (VS Code from Finder/Dock) inherit a stripped PATH without Homebrew, so the CLI's `yq`/`gh` lookups failed and the viewer showed an empty tree. The launcher now prepends `/opt/homebrew/bin:/usr/local/bin`, and resolves symlinks (so the npm global-bin symlink finds its Python). Verified under a simulated minimal PATH.

## Extension — v0.1.1 listing refresh
- **Six listing screenshots** (sidebar, dependency graph, public-repo modal, Untracked bucket, onboarding, command menu) + the README `Screenshots` section.
- **Expanded docs**: a real **Commands & controls** section explaining every command plus **filtering** (Select View lenses) and **sorting**; an **Install** section; status → published.
- **Independent per-registry publish jobs + `--skip-duplicate`** (the resilient `vscode-publish.yml`).
- Version bumped to **0.1.1**.

## Top-level README
- `npm install -g` path in Quick install + the per-platform table; a **VS Code extension** section (Marketplace/Open VSX + cliPath); an **Updating** table; a hero screenshot.

After merge: run **npm-publish** (first `@stylusnexus/work-plan` release) and **vscode-publish** (extension `0.1.1`, now with screenshots).

ci(vscode): Node CI job + Marketplace/Open VSX publish scaffolding (#87 Phase 4)

Promotes the **#87 Phase 4** CI + packaging plumbing to production so the extension's publish pipeline is live on `main`.

- **`vscode.yml`** — the extension's own Node CI (typecheck · `node --test` · esbuild · `vsce package` → VSIX artifact), scoped to `vscode/**`. The Python/Node boundary.
- **`vscode-publish.yml`** — publish job (VS Code Marketplace + Open VSX), **dormant** until a Release is cut or it's dispatched manually; uses the `VSCE_PAT` / `OVSX_TOKEN` repo secrets.
- **`vscode/package.json`** — Marketplace fields (repository, icon, keywords, …) + `package`/`publish:*` scripts + `@vscode/vsce` + `ovsx` devDeps.
- **`vscode/media/icon.png`** (real raster icon) + **`vscode/LICENSE`** (packaged into the VSIX) + the AGENTS.md Python/Node boundary note.

No CLI behavior change; the viewer's runtime is unchanged from the previous deploy. Tests green (Python matrix + the new `vscode.yml` job). After this lands, a `v0.1.0` Release publishes the extension.

feat: ship the VS Code viewer (Phases 1–3) — see, write, and onboard work-plan tracks (#87)

First production ship of the **`work-plan` VS Code viewer** — the human face of the CLI. Everything below was merged to `dev` incrementally (each PR reviewed + tested); this deploy promotes the whole viewer (Phases 1–3) plus its CLI seam to `main`.

## The viewer (`vscode/`)
**See** — a sidebar tree (repos → tracks: status dot, open count, blocked/next hints, ⚠ badge on public repos), a Mermaid dependency graph + per-track detail panel (focus toggle), **lenses** (filter by repo / milestone / blocked), **sort** (default / blocked / most-open / name), and an **Untracked bucket** per repo (open GitHub issues that no track references — click to open, right-click to slot).

**Act** — edit fields, set-next, slot, close, refresh, reconcile (draft preview), hygiene, and new-track — every action shells to the CLI. A **public-repo confirm modal** ("Write anyway / Keep private") fires before any write into a public (or unknown-visibility) repo and re-invokes with a confirm token; private repos write straight through.

**Onboard** — a cold-start a new user can drive without the CLI: an empty-state welcome with **Add a repo** and **Set notes location** buttons. Config is auto-seeded by the CLI on first run; a loading bar shows during fetches and concurrent refreshes are coalesced (single-flight).

## The CLI seam (`skills/work-plan/`)
- **`export --json`** (schema 1) — the viewer's read surface: every frontmatter'd track + an additive `untracked` list of open-issues-in-no-track per repo; batched GraphQL issue fetch for speed.
- Generic **`set <track> field=value`**, and a **non-interactive + confirm-token mode** for `slot` / `close` / `init` / `init-repo` (explicit flags instead of `input()` prompts), plus new one-shot **`new-track`** and **`set-notes-root`** commands — so the extension drives every write headlessly.
- **`lib/write_guard`** confirm-token gate; `assume_private_when_unknown` config opt-out for all-private teams (public repos always prompt).

## Notable fixes this cycle
- **#112** repo row read "private ⚠ public" (tier + visibility conflated) → fixed.
- **#95** tree loading indicator + single-flight refresh.
- **#99** Untracked bucket (CLI + viewer).
- **#113** opt out of the confirm gate on *unknown* visibility (PUBLIC never suppressed).
- An `applyLens` fix so additive export fields (like `untracked`) survive lens filtering.

## Tests
**448** offline Python (`unittest`) + **275** TS (`node --test`) green; build clean. The Python CI matrix (3.9–3.12 × ubuntu/macos/windows) runs on this PR. A dedicated `vscode/` CI job + Marketplace / Open VSX publishing are **Phase 4** (next).

Docs/chore deploy (no code):

- **Architecture docs** refreshed for the plugin era (one-engine-two-faces, plugin packaging, plan-status subsystem, corrected install flows, updated counts).
- **CONTRIBUTING.md**: PRs target `dev`; CI is configured; ~250 tests; git-native sharing in-scope.
- **notes/README.md**: corrected stale default-`notes_root` premise.

chore: untrack internal planning docs from public repo + plugin-first README

Production deploy. Two things:

- **Remove `docs/superpowers/` from the public repo.** Internal planning (specs/plans/mockups) is kept local going forward — `.gitignore` now excludes `docs/superpowers/`, `docs/specs/`, `docs/plans/`. This untracks the previously-committed files from `main` (local copies retained on disk; they remain in git history, not purged).
- **Plugin-first README** — badges, quick-install (Claude/Codex plugin + script), namespacing note (`/work-plan X` → `/work-plan:X`), marketplace link.

No code changes; full offline suite green (250 + bin test). `version-bump.yml` will bump CalVer + sync the manifests on merge.

Production deploy of the org-sharing work. Ships:

- **Phase 1 plugin packaging (#83):** `bin/work-plan` launcher, `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (CalVer), namespaced command suite (`/work-plan:brief` …), self-seeding config, dispatcher-only `install.sh`/`install.ps1` (lockstep), Windows `.cmd` launcher.
- **version-bump manifest sync (#84):** deploys now write CalVer into the plugin manifest(s) alongside VERSION.
- **Org-sharing specs + plans + repo-local `AGENTS.md`** (docs already on dev).

Verified: 250 unit tests + bin test green; real local `marketplace add → install → details` confirmed the namespaced suite with no name collision; CalVer passes `claude plugin validate`.

Post-merge: `version-bump.yml` will bump VERSION + sync the manifest; then this work becomes taggable for the `stylusnexus/agent-plugins` marketplace.

feat(status-table): sync missing canonical rows and slot them in frontmatter order (#77, #79)

Production deploy: dev → main. Ships two stacked changes to the canonical issue-table sync.

## What's shipping

- **#77 (#78)** — `refresh-md` and `handoff` now diff frontmatter `github.issues` against the status table and append a row for every newly-slotted issue (previously they only rewrote status cells of existing rows, so the body table drifted from frontmatter silently). Adds `render_issue_row`, `append_rows`, `sync_missing_rows`; live assignee fetch.
- **#79 (#81)** — `sync_missing_rows` now slots each missing row into its frontmatter-order position instead of tacking it onto the end, so the rendered table matches frontmatter ordering (Option A). Existing rows are re-emitted verbatim (minimal diff).

## Files (8)

`commands/canonicalize.py`, `commands/handoff.py`, `commands/refresh_md.py`, `lib/github_state.py`, `lib/status_table.py`, `tests/test_handoff_append_rows.py`, `tests/test_refresh_md.py`, `tests/test_status_table.py`

(The `main..dev` first-parent list shows ~40 commits — phantom diff from prior squash-merges. The genuine deploy is the 8 files above = #77 ∪ #79.)

## Tests

Full suite green (245). `cd skills/work-plan && python3 -m unittest discover tests`

fix(ci): deploy automation — version-bump on PR-merge, auto-CHANGELOG, docs refresh

## Deploy — fix the version-bump trigger + add auto-CHANGELOG

- **CI fix:** `version-bump.yml` now fires on `pull_request: closed (merged)` (a `gh --admin` merge doesn't emit a `push` event, which is why VERSION stalled at 2026.04.30 since deploys #65/#67/#74) + a `workflow_dispatch` manual fallback.
- **CHANGELOG:** the workflow now prepends an entry from each deploy PR's title/body; `CHANGELOG.md` seeded with the full 34-deploy backfilled history.
- **Docs:** README/SECURITY refreshed for the full plan-status surface (`--llm`, `--archive`, `--issues`, 🧳 foreign), test count 202 → 234.

Once this lands on `main`, the new trigger governs future deploys (auto VERSION bump + CHANGELOG). A manual `workflow_dispatch` will stamp today's VERSION immediately after merge.
