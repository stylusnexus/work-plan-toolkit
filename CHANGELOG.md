## 2026.06.11+b34452d — 2026-06-11 (#265)

feat: canonical plan branch for the shared tier + visibility×tier badge (extension 0.4.1)

Production deploy. Extension bumped to **0.4.1**. Ships the #260 canonical-plan-branch feature (CLI) and the #259 visibility × tier badge (VS Code viewer).

## CLI — shared-tier planning on one canonical branch (#260)

The shared (`.work-plan/`) tier can now be pinned to **one canonical `plan_branch`** per repo, read and written through a dedicated git worktree — so planning lives off your code branches and never pollutes feature PRs or the `dev → main` deploy diff, yet the CLI and viewer always show the canonical plan from any checkout.

- **`plan-branch <init|status|push> <repo>`** — the bootstrap + share command. `init` creates an **orphan** branch (default `work-plan/plan`, like `gh-pages`; `--branch` overrides) with a `.work-plan/` skeleton, or **connects** to a teammate's already-published branch — **local only**. `status` reports exists / published / unpushed. `push` shares it, gated by a confirm token on **public** repos (with `--dry-run` to preview the exposure first).
- Discovery, shared-track creation (`group`/`new-track`), and the dispatcher's auto-commit all route through the plan-branch worktree when one is configured; repos without a `plan_branch` keep the legacy working-tree `.work-plan/` behaviour unchanged.
- Hardened to the notes-vcs data-safety bar across multiple adversarial review rounds: scoped commits (only the paths a command changed, NUL-delimited porcelain so spaced/non-ASCII filenames are safe), branch-verified worktree reuse, the public-repo exposure gate fails closed, and the whole path honours the never-raise contract.

## VS Code viewer — visibility × tier badge (#259), extension 0.4.1

Every tree item now carries a **visibility × tier badge** (🔒 private / 🌐 public repo, ☁ shared tier) that flags the one **exposed** state — a plan committed to a *public* repo's shared tier is world-visible. Theme-adaptive, with a MarkdownString tooltip explaining the state.

## Docs
README gains a "Canonical plan branch" section (with the CI-exclude tip) and a `plan-branch` command-table row; the extension README documents the badge and the 0.4.1 status.

Closes #259, #260.

## 2026.06.11+8c21445 — 2026-06-11 (#258)

feat: viewer UX + accessibility overhaul, notes-vcs safety, CLI clarity (extension 0.4.0)

Production deploy. Extension bumped to **0.4.0** (feature-heavy, non-breaking).

### VS Code viewer — UX
- **De-noised command palette**: commands moved the `Work Plan:` prefix into the `category` field, so titles are clean, searchable verbs; argument-only commands gated out of the palette.
- **Clearer command names**: *Refresh Track Body → Sync Issue States from GitHub*, *Reconcile (preview) → Check Label Drift (preview)*, *Slot Issue into Track → Add Issue to Track*, *Set Next-Up → Set Next-Up & Log Session* (it runs `handoff --set-next`, which also logs a session). CLI `--help` aligned.
- **Frequency-grouped track context menu** with separators fencing the destructive actions, plus **confirmation modals** before *abandon* (Close) and *Rename*.
- **Per-milestone filter**: an explicit *filter* control on each milestone band re-scopes the whole view; the result is clearable straight from its toast.
- **Progress feedback** on every write command.

### VS Code viewer — theming & accessibility
- **Editor-theme-adaptive** webview: Mermaid graph + detail-card colours follow light / dark / high-contrast (via `--vscode-charts-*` tokens + a forced-colors fallback), re-rendering on theme change.
- **Accessibility sweep**: distinct *shapes* for track status (not colour alone), keyboard-operable disclosures and depends-on chips with `aria-expanded`/labels, focus-visible move button, table `scope`/caption semantics, a graph text alternative, and a non-colour `⛔` marker on blocked graph nodes.

### Local history (notes-vcs) — opt-in, hardened
- Opt-in personal version control for the private `notes_root` tier with one-click Undo in the viewer, now with **safety boundaries**: refuses a `notes_root` that has a git remote or is a repo work-plan didn't create; commits **only the files a command changed** (pre-existing edits preserved); Undo/revert is gated on repo ownership + no-remote and on the new commit sitting directly on the previously-seen HEAD.

### CLI & housekeeping
- Clarified `refresh-md` / `reconcile` / `set` vs `handoff --set-next` help text.
- Stopped tracking agent scratch state (`.claude/agent-memory`, worktrees) in this public repo.

Closes #103, #207, #208, #214, #217, #218, #219, #224, #227, #228, #229, #230, #231, #232, #233, #238, #244, #248, #249, #250.

## 2026.06.10+a3d10bf — 2026-06-10 (#222)

feat: rename-track + milestone-ordered tracks (CLI & viewer)

Production deploy. Highlights since the last release:

### `rename-track` (#174)
New `rename-track <old-slug | old@repo> <new-slug>` CLI verb — renames a track's slug: moves the `.md` file (write-new-then-unlink-old, so a failed write leaves the original intact), updates the frontmatter `track` field + `last_touched`, and reuses the public-repo confirm-token gate. Shared tracks get an opt-in `--commit`; `--fix-refs` rewrites sibling tracks' `depends_on`. Surfaced in the VS Code viewer as a **Rename Track** right-click action.

### Milestone ordering within tracks (#101)
A track that mixes near-term and far-future issues now keeps "what's next" above "someday", everywhere it renders:
- **Viewer:** per-track milestone bands are ordered active-milestone-first (the track's `milestone_alignment` band first), not alphabetically.
- **CLI:** the canonical issue table is a single milestone-ordered table with a `Milestone` column (active milestone first, groups divided by a blank row). `refresh-md` re-derives it each run, so it self-heals instead of decaying. Replaces the old multi-section rendering that didn't round-trip.
- No-drift by construction: the markdown table and the viewer both derive order from the one `milestone_sort_key`; the canonicalize → refresh-md round-trip is byte-identical.

### VS Code extension → v0.3.6
Adds the Rename Track action and active-milestone-first band ordering. Marketplace + Open VSX.

### Docs
- CLAUDE.md: cross-project **model-routing** guidance; a deploy note to keep the `vscode/README.md` Status line in lockstep with the extension version.

## 2026.06.10+9dce675 — 2026-06-10 (#203)

fix(security): CLI + VS Code extension hardening (injection fixes, extension RCE)

Security release from a full review of the CLI and the VS Code extension, plus CI and public-repo hygiene. VS Code extension → 0.3.5; npm CLI republished.

### Security fixes
- **yq expression injection** in `set-notes-root` — a path containing `"` could rewrite arbitrary `config.yml` keys. Values now pass to `yq` via `strenv()`/`env()` (#191).
- **git option injection** via dash-led `github.branches` frontmatter → arbitrary file overwrite (`git log --output=`). Dash-led revs are now rejected (#192).
- **VS Code extension RCE** — `workPlan.cliPath` was workspace-overridable and spawned on activation. Now machine-scoped + `untrustedWorkspaces: { supported: false }` (#193).
- **Argument injection** via `--`-prefixed track names — CLI now honours a `--` end-of-options separator and rejects dash-led track filenames; the extension passes positionals after `--` (#194).
- **Hardening**: path-write containment + symlink-write guard (#195); `gh`/`git` subprocess timeouts, repo-slug validation, answers int-coercion (#196); webview confirm-modal consistency, Mermaid label newline handling, CSP/escaper nits (#197).

### Also in this release
- **CI**: GitHub Actions bumped to Node-24 majors (checkout v6, setup-node v6, upload-artifact v7, download-artifact v8) (#190).
- **Public-repo readiness**: CLAUDE.md now tracked for contributors; internal project references + a leaked maintainer path scrubbed repo-wide; SECURITY.md advisory history updated; issue templates + agent-doc cross-links added (#200, #201).

### Versions
- VS Code extension → **0.3.5**
- npm CLI republished (same-day CalVer, `-1` suffix)

Full suite green (Python 657 + lint matrix; vscode typecheck + 335 tests).

## 2026.06.10+a6052bf — 2026-06-10 (#189)

feat: reconcile auto-move + non-TTY hang fix, list --sort, viewer status lens

Production deploy. Ships four issues plus docs and the VS Code extension bump to 0.3.4.

### Fixes
- **#183 — `fix(prompts)`: non-TTY prompt hang.** `hygiene`/`reconcile` launched from the VS Code extension could block forever on a prompt (stdin is an open pipe that never delivers a line and never EOFs). All prompt helpers now fall back to their default when stdin is not a TTY. Adds `reconcile --yes` (auto-apply, local-write only) and `hygiene` forwards it.

### Features
- **#163 — `feat(reconcile)`: label-driven auto-move.** In an `--all`/`--repo` sweep, an issue relabeled from one track to another in the same repo is moved (removed from the old, added to the new) instead of dangling as a FLAG + duplicate ADD. Ambiguous targets stay FLAGs. PUBLIC-repo destinations are skipped under `--yes`.
- **#181 — `feat(list)`: `--sort`.** `list --sort=recent` (by `last_touched`) and `--sort=priority` (P0→P3, recency tiebreak); default keeps discovery order.
- **#180 — `feat(viewer)`: status filter lens.** New Active / Shipped / Parked lens in the VS Code viewer's Select View.

### Chore / docs
- VS Code extension bumped `0.3.3 → 0.3.4` for the status-lens Marketplace + Open VSX release.
- README + vscode/README updated for the new flags and lens.

Full suite green (644 tests).

docs: update READMEs for v0.3.2 features

README updates for the v0.3.2 feature set: move subcommand, depends_on chips, repo-scoped full map.

## 2026.06.09+03c8f5e — 2026-06-09 (#177)

Deploy: repo-scoped full map (v0.3.2)

## Change
The 'Show full map' graph now only shows tracks in the **same repo** as the selected track. Cross-repo tracks share no edges, so showing them together produced noise without value.

- Focus mode: unchanged (neighbourhood of selected track)
- Full map: scoped to selected track's repo

## Version
VSCode extension → 0.3.2

Deploy: Mermaid fix + move subcommand + depends_on surface (#172, #162, #102)

## Changes in this deploy

### #172 — Mermaid label escaping fix
- Replaced HTML entities with safe literal characters in `mermaidLabel`
- Mermaid 11.x's `entityDecode` was silently undoing all entity escaping, allowing `"]` sequences to break the parser
- Fix: `"` → `'`, `[{` → `(`, `]}` → `)`, backtick → `'`

### #173 — `move` subcommand + VSCode right-click
- CLI `move` subcommand (source-first: `work-plan move <issue> <from> <to>`)
- VSCode context menu "Move Issue from Track" with QuickPick destination
- Added to `WriteAction` type with full public-repo confirm gate
- 13 CLI tests + 1 VSCode test

### #175 — Surface `depends_on` in detail panel + README
- New "Depends on:" section in VSCode detail panel with clickable amber chips
- README documentation for cross-track dependencies
- 2 new detail panel tests

## Verification
- 620 Python tests pass
- 308 VSCode tests pass

## 2026.06.09+f86ff30 — 2026-06-09

**Features:**
- **orient**: `--repo=<key>` and `track@repo` disambiguation (#166, closes #129)

feat(shared-notes,coverage,auto-triage): two-tier tracks, coverage report, AI triage, next_up fix

## What's shipping

### Major: shared-notes (two-tier track storage)
Track files can now live inside a repo clone (`.work-plan/<slug>.md`, git-synced) alongside the existing private `notes_root` tier. Register a local clone with `init-repo --local=<path>`; tracks route there automatically. Teammates share planning state via `git pull`/`git push`. `--private` opts out per-command.

Phases A–D:
- Phase A: `discover_tracks` unions shared + private; `AmbiguousTrackError` for same-slug-different-repo
- Phase B: `--repo=<key>` / `<track>@<repo>` disambiguation on all write verbs
- Phase C: write-surface routing (`group`, `new-track`, `close`, `init`)
- Phase D: `init-repo` detects existing `.work-plan/` tracks; `new-track --commit`; `export` tier field

### New: `coverage` command
`/work-plan coverage [--repo=<key>] [--list]` — reports how many open issues are outside the track model. 42% orphan rate measured on a real production repo.

### New: `auto-triage` command
`/work-plan auto-triage [--repo=<key>] [--apply]` — two-step AI assignment of untracked issues to existing tracks. Complements `group` (which creates new tracks).

### Fix: closed issues filtered from `next_up` in export
The VS Code viewer was showing closed issues as actionable next-up nodes. Export now cross-references `next_up` against the fetched issue states and removes confirmed-closed entries.

### Docs
README, SKILL.md, npm description, and VS Code extension description updated with shared-notes setup, group/auto-triage callouts, and `@repo` disambiguation syntax.

feat: npm CLI distribution + launcher PATH fix + extension v0.1.1 (screenshots, docs)

Production deploy bundling the post-launch polish: npm distribution for the CLI, the GUI-PATH launcher fix, expanded docs, and the assets/version bump for the extension's `0.1.1` listing refresh.

## CLI — npm distribution
- **`@stylusnexus/work-plan` npm package** (root `package.json` + `scripts/npm-check-deps.js`): ships the Python CLI + launcher so `npm install -g @stylusnexus/work-plan` works (no repo clone). `files`-whitelisted (488 kB, no leaks); pure Python still, no build step. Plus `.github/workflows/npm-publish.yml` (CalVer→semver, `--access public`, `NPM_TOKEN`).
- **Launcher GUI-PATH fix** (`bin/work-plan`): GUI editors (VS Code from Finder/Dock) inherit a stripped PATH without Homebrew, so the CLI's `yq`/`gh` lookups failed and the viewer showed an empty tree. The launcher now prepends `/opt/homebrew/bin:/usr/local/bin`, and resolves symlinks (so the npm global-bin symlink finds its Python). Verified under a simulated minimal PATH.

## Extension — v0.1.1 listing refresh
- **Six listing screenshots** (sidebar, dependency graph, public-repo modal, Untracked bucket, onboarding, command menu) + the README `Screenshots` section.
- **Expanded docs**: a real **Commands & controls** section explaining every command plus **filtering** (Select View lenses) and **sorting**; an **Install** section; status → published.
- **Independent per-registry publish jobs + `--skip-duplicate`** (the resilient `vscode-publish.yml`).
- Version bumped to **0.1.1**.

## Top-level README
- `npm install -g` path in Quick install + the per-platform table; a **VS Code extension** section (Marketplace/Open VSX + cliPath); an **Updating** table; a hero screenshot.

After merge: run **npm-publish** (first `@stylusnexus/work-plan` release) and **vscode-publish** (extension `0.1.1`, now with screenshots).

feat: ship the VS Code viewer (Phases 1–3) — see, write, and onboard work-plan tracks (#87)

First production ship of the **`work-plan` VS Code viewer** — the human face of the CLI. Everything below was merged to `dev` incrementally (each PR reviewed + tested); this deploy promotes the whole viewer (Phases 1–3) plus its CLI seam to `main`.

## The viewer (`vscode/`)
**See** — a sidebar tree (repos → tracks: status dot, open count, blocked/next hints, ⚠ badge on public repos), a Mermaid dependency graph + per-track detail panel (focus toggle), **lenses** (filter by repo / milestone / blocked), **sort** (default / blocked / most-open / name), and an **Untracked bucket** per repo (open GitHub issues that no track references — click to open, right-click to slot).

**Act** — edit fields, set-next, slot, close, refresh, reconcile (draft preview), hygiene, and new-track — every action shells to the CLI. A **public-repo confirm modal** ("Write anyway / Keep private") fires before any write into a public (or unknown-visibility) repo and re-invokes with a confirm token; private repos write straight through.

**Onboard** — a cold-start a new user can drive without the CLI: an empty-state welcome with **Add a repo** and **Set notes location** buttons. Config is auto-seeded by the CLI on first run; a loading bar shows during fetches and concurrent refreshes are coalesced (single-flight).

## The CLI seam (`skills/work-plan/`)
- **`export --json`** (schema 1) — the viewer's read surface: every frontmatter'd track + an additive `untracked` list of open-issues-in-no-track per repo; batched GraphQL issue fetch for speed.
- Generic **`set <track> field=value`**, and a **non-interactive + confirm-token mode** for `slot` / `close` / `init` / `init-repo` (explicit flags instead of `input()` prompts), plus new one-shot **`new-track`** and **`set-notes-root`** commands — so the extension drives every write headlessly.
- **`lib/write_guard`** confirm-token gate; `assume_private_when_unknown` config opt-out for all-private teams (public repos always prompt).

## Notable fixes this cycle
- **#112** repo row read "private ⚠ public" (tier + visibility conflated) → fixed.
- **#95** tree loading indicator + single-flight refresh.
- **#99** Untracked bucket (CLI + viewer).
- **#113** opt out of the confirm gate on *unknown* visibility (PUBLIC never suppressed).
- An `applyLens` fix so additive export fields (like `untracked`) survive lens filtering.

## Tests
**448** offline Python (`unittest`) + **275** TS (`node --test`) green; build clean. The Python CI matrix (3.9–3.12 × ubuntu/macos/windows) runs on this PR. A dedicated `vscode/` CI job + Marketplace / Open VSX publishing are **Phase 4** (next).

- **CONTRIBUTING.md**: PRs target `dev`; CI is configured; ~250 tests; git-native sharing in-scope.
- **notes/README.md**: corrected stale default-`notes_root` premise.
- **shims**: add `plan-status`; plugin-first framing.

chore: untrack internal planning docs from public repo + plugin-first README

Production deploy. Two things:

- **Remove `docs/superpowers/` from the public repo.** Internal planning (specs/plans/mockups) is kept local going forward — `.gitignore` now excludes `docs/superpowers/`, `docs/specs/`, `docs/plans/`. This untracks the previously-committed files from `main` (local copies retained on disk; they remain in git history, not purged).
- **Plugin-first README** — badges, quick-install (Claude/Codex plugin + script), namespacing note (`/work-plan X` → `/work-plan:X`), marketplace link.

No code changes; full offline suite green (250 + bin test). `version-bump.yml` will bump CalVer + sync the manifests on merge.

feat(plugin): Codex plugin manifest + install-paths docs/CI

Production deploy carrying Phase 2 + Phase 3 leftovers.

- **Codex plugin manifest (#86):** `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` (with `"skills": "./skills/"`), so Codex users get a native manifest. Verified: `codex plugin add` installs it (enabled) with both skills in the cache.
- **Install docs + CI (#88):** README three-install-paths section (Claude plugin / Codex plugin / install.sh); `tests/test_bin_wrapper.py` wired into CI (Linux/macOS).

`version-bump.yml` will bump VERSION and sync **both** manifests (`.claude-plugin` + `.codex-plugin`) on merge. After this, the next tag + marketplace `ref` bump publishes the Codex manifest to installed users.

feat(plugin): Claude Code plugin packaging (Phase 1) + org-sharing specs

Production deploy of the org-sharing work. Ships:

- **Phase 1 plugin packaging (#83):** `bin/work-plan` launcher, `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (CalVer), namespaced command suite (`/work-plan:brief` …), self-seeding config, dispatcher-only `install.sh`/`install.ps1` (lockstep), Windows `.cmd` launcher.
- **version-bump manifest sync (#84):** deploys now write CalVer into the plugin manifest(s) alongside VERSION.
- **Org-sharing specs + plans + repo-local `AGENTS.md`** (docs already on dev).

Verified: 250 unit tests + bin test green; real local `marketplace add → install → details` confirmed the namespaced suite with no name collision; CalVer passes `claude plugin validate`.

Post-merge: `version-bump.yml` will bump VERSION + sync the manifest; then this work becomes taggable for the `stylusnexus/agent-plugins` marketplace.

feat(status-table): sync missing canonical rows and slot them in frontmatter order (#77, #79)

Production deploy: dev → main. Ships two stacked changes to the canonical issue-table sync.

## What's shipping

- **#77 (#78)** — `refresh-md` and `handoff` now diff frontmatter `github.issues` against the status table and append a row for every newly-slotted issue (previously they only rewrote status cells of existing rows, so the body table drifted from frontmatter silently). Adds `render_issue_row`, `append_rows`, `sync_missing_rows`; live assignee fetch.
- **#79 (#81)** — `sync_missing_rows` now slots each missing row into its frontmatter-order position instead of tacking it onto the end, so the rendered table matches frontmatter ordering (Option A). Existing rows are re-emitted verbatim (minimal diff).

## Files (8)

`commands/canonicalize.py`, `commands/handoff.py`, `commands/refresh_md.py`, `lib/github_state.py`, `lib/status_table.py`, `tests/test_handoff_append_rows.py`, `tests/test_refresh_md.py`, `tests/test_status_table.py`

(The `main..dev` first-parent list shows ~40 commits — phantom diff from prior squash-merges. The genuine deploy is the 8 files above = #77 ∪ #79.)

## Tests

Full suite green (245). `cd skills/work-plan && python3 -m unittest discover tests`

fix(ci): deploy automation — version-bump on PR-merge, auto-CHANGELOG, docs refresh

## Deploy — fix the version-bump trigger + add auto-CHANGELOG

- **CI fix:** `version-bump.yml` now fires on `pull_request: closed (merged)` (a `gh --admin` merge doesn't emit a `push` event, which is why VERSION stalled at 2026.04.30 since deploys #65/#67/#74) + a `workflow_dispatch` manual fallback.
- **CHANGELOG:** the workflow now prepends an entry from each deploy PR's title/body; `CHANGELOG.md` seeded with the full 34-deploy backfilled history.
- **Docs:** README/SECURITY refreshed for the full plan-status surface (`--llm`, `--archive`, `--issues`, 🧳 foreign), test count 202 → 234.

Once this lands on `main`, the new trigger governs future deploys (auto VERSION bump + CHANGELOG). A manual `workflow_dispatch` will stamp today's VERSION immediately after merge.

feat(plan-status): doc/plan liveness tracking (report, stamp, LLM, reconcile, foreign)

Shipped the complete `work-plan plan-status` capability: a read-only liveness report (✅ shipped / 🟡 partial / 💀 dead / 👻 manifest-less / 🧳 foreign), idempotent status-header stamping (`--stamp`), two-step LLM verdicts for prose/ambiguous docs (`--llm`), and gated reconcile actions (`--archive`, `--issues`). Phases #68, #70, #71, #72, #73.
